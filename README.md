# Calculator

Calculator is a progressive web app, it loads from the web but can install as an app.
Calculator was built from the [polymer starter kit](http://polymer-project.org) version 1.7.
It was developed from the [paper calculator](https://github.com/Polymer/paper-calculator) developed for Polymer-0.5.
It also uses [JSEP](http://jsep.from.so/) as a basis for its expression parser.
But the principle inspiration for Calculator is [A Geometric Calculator](http://elf.org/calculator/) 
a way too early attempt at a progressive web app and
a way too late implementation of a reverse polish desk calculator
that implements the [Clifford Geometric Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra) over Euclidean 3 dimensional space.
